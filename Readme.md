Abstraction
It is the definition of the behavior and properties of a class.

Abstract classes are generally used when implementing inheritance.
They cannot be transferred to the object and used with the new word.
The use of all methods of classes derived from abstract classes is mandatory.
A class can only inherit from an abstract class.
They cannot be defined as static.
